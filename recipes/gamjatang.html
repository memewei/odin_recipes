        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gamjatang is a popular Korean soup. It goes well with a bowl of steamed rice to complete a meal
            but some people pair it with Korean liquor - soju as a drinking snack
        </p>
        <p>One interesting fact about gamjatang, is its name. Because gamjatang literally translates to "potato soup", but 
            the highlight of this soup is actually pork bones.

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the pork bones in cold water for at least an hour (to get rid of any excess red liquid that looks like blood).
                Drain away the water. If you can, try to change the water every 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Place the bones into a large pot and add enough water to cover the bones, then boil it for about 10 minutes over
                medium-high heat, covered, Drain away the water and rinse the bones in cold running water.
            </li>
            <li>In a large clean pot, place the bones and add the water (7cups) and all the ingredients from the "Aromatic Vegetables" section. 
                Simmer it on medium to low heat for 1 hour 30 minutes, covered.
            </li>
            <li>While the bone broth is simmering:  Put the potatoes in a separate pot and add enough water to cover them. Boil it over 
                medium-high heat until the potatoes are nearly cooked (about 90%). Drain away the water and set aside the potatoes until needed.
            </li>
            <li>In a separate pot, add some water and the salt and boil it. Once the water is rapidly boiling, parboil the napa cabbage for 1-2 minutes. Drain away the water
                and cool down the leaves. Tear down each leaf length ways.
            </li>
            <li>Sieve the broth through the strainer and catch the broth in a large bowl. Also, keep the pork bones but discard any boiled spices/vegeatables. 
                It should result in just under 5 cups of broth.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the broth into a clean pot then add the pork bones, potatoes, cabbage leaves and the seasoning base into the pot. Boil over medium-high 
                heat until the potatoes cook completely (10-15 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining vegetables and the ground sesame seeds into the pot and boil for another 1-2 minutes until they soften. 
                Serve warm with steamed rice.
